 -> what happens when you initialize a repo and why do you need to do it?
    
 when we initialize a repo a git file is created which tracks the status of the file then onwards 
 we do it since otherwise the status of our files will not be tracked.

 -> how is staging area different from working directory and repository? what value it offers?

 staging areascan be used to make specific files commited at once as opposed to only one or all files thus 
 making it easier to make one commit per logical change working directory is simply the directory we are
 working with and repository is where git stores all info regarding commits changes etc.
