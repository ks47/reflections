-> how diff helps in version control?

using diff command we can see line by line the difference between two files
this can thus help us detect the bug that was present in the new code
that includes any typo that may have occured or any mistake that can occure 
in the new version of the project

-> how easy access to previous versions makes us better programmer?

through easy access of previous versions we can access or go back to any
version of a program we want to go to we can check out any changes we made 
to the program or take away or bring back any feature we want

-> manual version control like git vs auto vc like goole docs

* manual vc allows us to commit logical changes whenever we like 
* auto vc helps save changes regularly thus saving us from info being
 lost due to things like power outage etc 

-> why vc git like have allow saving multiple files in one commit while vc
          like google docs dont

 vc like git are built for software dev where multiple files have the same
 content like functions variables etc whereas google docs is made for 
 office work etc. which usually have all related content in one particular
 file so there is no need for the files to be saved in a particular commit

-> how can we use git log and git diff to view history of files

 we can use them to view history files by using git log to check a file by 
 particular message that changed them and git diff to check differences 
 between two versions of a file and compare how diff they are

-> how can ability to go to previous versions make you more confident to make
 changes that might break the software

 we can easily go back to the previous unbroken version if anything happens 
 thus we can easily add more risky changes as well
